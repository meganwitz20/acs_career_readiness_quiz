Kristen Harper- Hello! 

I hope you’ve been doing well, I know it’s been a while since we’ve last spoken. Sad to have missed you at the high school reunion last year. How are Chad and your mom not seeing them for a while when I visited my grandparents in Edna?

I’m reaching out to let you know that I’ve decided to pursue a career in the tech industry. I’m currently completing Full-stack web development at BloomTech, an online coding boot camp. Right now I’m seeking advice from anyone who works in the field as I know transitioning industries is never easy and want to set myself up for success. My question for you is do you happen to know anyone that works in tech that might be beneficial for me to connect with? 

Specifically, I'm interested in learning more about different roles within the tech industry, gaining insights into the day-to-day responsibilities of tech professionals, and understanding the skills and experiences that are valued most in the field.

I appreciate any help you can provide and will continue to stay in touch as I continue this journey! 

Best, 

Megan Freitas
